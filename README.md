# Slides from the GodotFest 25 talk "My experience porting Godot games to Nintendo Switch".

I prepared the content in a TXT file, thinking about formatting and putting steps/images/animations later in Google Slides, but I ended up coding, in a moment, a small parser in Godot.
Doing it in this way also helped me to iterate the content quickly.

Not my best code, but it did the job. And it includes a "fun visual tip" that will show after 20 minutes, to let you know (but not your audience) that 1200 seconds have passed. Instead, your audience will think that you're a cheapskate and that you don't pay for Windows 🙃

For a quick read, just open the `content/content.txt` file.
