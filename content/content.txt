- My XP porting Godot games to Nintendo Switch™
slide=title
		- There is no easy port.
		- Nintendo Switch™ is a trademark of Nintendo.

- Before we get started
slide=base
	- Disclaimer: 100% my experience as a small publisher
	- "Your mileage may vary" a lot.
	
- Who am I?
slide=left_image
image=panreyes.jpg
	- Pablo Navarro, 39 y.o., software developer.
	- Making 2D games since age 13.
	
	- Formerly PiXJuegos.
	- Involved in BennuGD & PixTudio.
	
	- Known in the Godot scene for the "RAWRLAB's Godot ports".
	
	- Please excuse my speaking, not used to it.
	
	- I pronounce Godot as Godot. Deal with it.


- What is RAWRLAB Games?
slide=right_image
image=rawrlab.png
	- Indie game studio founded in 2012 to make eXplosive Dinosaurs
			- Originally for OUYA.

	- Game developers trying to do indie porting & publishing.
	
	- Sometimes it's "we", sometimes it's "I", but mostly me.
		- With collaborators from all around the globe.

	- Trying to "make it" with near-zero costs/risks.
			- Near-zero risk means you won't get rich fast,
				- but you won't lose your house either.

	- 2012-2018: Made XD in PixTudio, a custom game engine.
		- · No publishers would port it, so I learnt how to do it myself.

image=spybros.png
	- May, 2022: Started developing "Spy Bros.".
		- · Got interested in making it with Godot.
		- · No Godot port was available at an accessible price at the time (starting from 3,000€ for Nintendo Switch).
		- · Ended up making Spy Bros with my engine, PixTudio.

	- July, 2022:
		- Found out that someone was sharing a free basic Godot 3.x port on Nintendo Developer Portal's forums.
	- Ported two first Godot games for Flynn's Arcade:

	- September, 2022: IndieDevDay.
		- · Many game studios were looking for help to "just release their game on Nintendo Switch".
		- · I decided to become a publisher, to help projects that did not fit in my partner's, Flynn's Arcade's, already filled release slots.

slide=left_image
	- December, 2023: 
		- · I was the main user of this Nintendo Switch Godot port.
		- · The original creator wanted to leave it in someone else's hands.
		- · I took the lead of this "community" port and asked Nintendo for permission to publicly announce its existence.
	
	- January, 2024:
		- · Publicly announced it! 🥳

	- September, 2024:
image=catboy.jpg
		- · I noticed that a few studios started making nice games for GB, so I also started porting a few of them.

- RAWRLAB's Services: Porting
slide=right_image
image=nswitch.jpg
	- Our numbers:
		- · 10 games ported for other publishers.
		- · 12 games ported for publishing as RAWRLAB Games.

	- What is porting for us?
		- · Platform: Adapt the game to Nintendo's guidelines.
		- · QA: We will not ship a game until it's free of bugs*.
		- · UX: Polish and provide the best possible gamefeel.
		- · Optimization: A lot of tricks to make the game run smooth.

- RAWRLAB's Services: Porting
slide=right_image
image=nswitch.jpg
	- What do we port?
		- · Godot 3.x and 4.x.
		- · GB games (GBStudio, ZGB)
		- · SDL2/3 based engines/games (BennuGD, PixTudio, AGS, raylib)

	- What can't we port?
		- · Broken games, or without a minimal architecture.
		- · Games coded in non-latin characters.
		- · Games that don't run well in a standard PC.
		- · Multiplayer, C# and some GDExtensions.

- RAWRLAB's Services: Porting
slide=right_image
image=nswitch.jpg
	- How long does each game take to port?
		- · Between one or two weeks of work.
		- · Not taking into account possible delays.

	- How much do we make?
		- · Profit-share, for small games: 20%
		- · Fixed-fee, from €3,000
		
		- · 20% sounds like a lot, 
			- but for smaller games it's around 500€ the first month
			- and bigger games won't go for profit share.

- RAWRLAB's Services: Publishing
slide=right_image
image=rawrlab.png
	- We publish small games made with love.
	- Side job, my living luckily does not depend on this.

	- Lately, publishers are seen as business angels
			- but good publishers are just good partners.

	- What can't we do:
		- · Funding or giving money upfront.
	- What won't we do:
		- · Recoup.
		- · Lie to the developer or give them false expectations.

- RAWRLAB's Services: Publishing
slide=left_image
image=rawrlab.png
	- What do we do:
		- · Work with the developer to polish the game.
		- · Port it.
		- · Prepare the store assets.
		- · Promote it as far as we can.
		- · Billing.
		- · Invest a lot of our time.
		- · Go in the same boat as the developer.

	- How much do we make?
		- · Profit share, 35%
		- · (not much from smaller games)

- RAWRLAB's Services: Publishing

image=rawrlab.png
	- Pure honesty.
		- "My games have sold between 100 and 2,500 copies the first month."
		- "If you count on the sales of this game to pay your bills, I'm afraid I can't help you."

	- Not even making half Spanish minimal wage from our profit shares.

	- Sales ratio between Steam x NS:
		- Most smaller games sell 5x on Nintendo Switch than Steam.
		- (but that's definitely not true for every game)

- RAWRLAB's Godot ports
image=nswitch_murtop.jpg
	- NOT created by me, but, currently, I promote and maintain them.
	- Free, MIT License: Provided "AS IS", no support, no warranty.
	- Good enough for most small to mid-size games.
	- Available as a Nintendo Middleware, for NS1&2.
	- 3.6 and 4.5 are the current stable versions.
	- With each game ported, the ports get more mature.
	- Currently 226 game developers have access to them.
	- The users of those ports also contribute back.
	- If you need help, there's a small community in the repository.
	- Or you can find a lot of people that offer consulting services.

- RAWRLAB's Godot ports
slide=left_image
image=nswitch_murtop.jpg
		- "We made this port, it's thanks to us".
	- Nope.

	- Godot is like the Everest mountain, and our work is just one grain of salt on top of it.

	- If a game runs well with this port it's 99,9% thanks to the optimizations made to Android, Vulkan and multithreading, by many independent contributors and companies like W4Games.


- RAWRLAB's Godot ports
slide=left_image
image=nswitch_murtop.jpg
	- It doesn't mean that we didn't put a lot of effort there, but seeing things at its scale it's just that grain of salt.
	
	- I'm just very glad to be able to contribute to Godot's ecosystem, although my contributions are only available for Nintendo Switch developers.
	
		- (On the good side, I can just commit my improvements without having to deal with other people 🙃)
		- (And, as you can see, it's quite difficult for me to defend my PRs in English 😅)

- 25-MINUTE INTRODUCTION COMPLETED
slide=title
	- Thank you for your attention. Now I'll get started with the real topic of my talk:
		- THE TRUTH BEHIND THE TRUTH! (Plot twist!?)

- TTBTT: About porting
slide=right_image
image=nswitch.jpg
	- Porting a game is not about knowing your game engine, it's about knowing the platform's internals, its requirements and a LOT of love for solving puzzles.

	- Having a working export template is just the first step of 10.

	- You're on your own with self-porting:
image=broken_switch.png
		- If something is broken, it's on you.

	- Almost everything will work as expected. Almost...
		- Almost might mean a few workarounds, a few days debugging, or to have to abandon an impossible port.
		- It happened one time, and trust me, I really tried.

- TTBTT: Working with consoles
slide=base
	- NDAs. Can't say much, but...
	
	- All platforms currently have indie programs.
	- If you send them a good pitch for an appealing game, they'll probably let you in.
	
	- Sony:
		- · Recently applied and accepted as partner. Waiting for a moment to get started.
	
	- Microsoft:
		- · ID@Xbox is nice. Accepted as partner and received Xbox devkits.
		- · But MS bureaucracy is... complicated. My verification took 1 year.
		- · (Luckily, this process has improved a lot lately!)

- TTBTT: Working with consoles
	- Nintendo:
		- · Partner since 2021.
		- · Easy and accessible. 
		- · Everything is well documented and with a clear path.
		- · Lots of sanity checks everywhere to catch mistakes early. Helps if you have ADD.
		- · Their staff help a lot, and they'll find bugs you'd never imagine.
	
	- Hopefully, I will be able to say the same things about Sony and Microsoft sooner than later!

- TTBTT: Porting tips
	- Based on my experiencies, mostly 2D games.
	- Don't copy them now, I'll share the slides later :)
		- #1. Optimize the game for a mid-tier Android device.
		- #2. Don't use Godot 3.x for mid/large-sized projects
				- (often suffering from frame pacing issues).
		- #3. Only use stable versions of Godot.
		- #4. We have loads of RAM, but less CPU and GPU.
		- #5. Bake and preload as much as you can.
		- #6. Static art should not use shaders.
				- (Using modulate does not hit performance.)

- TTBTT: Porting tips
		- #7. An static background should just be a texture. Prerrender them to one texture.
		- #8. Use as few real-time lights as possible.
		- #9. Most Light2Ds can be replaced with Sprite2D with additive blending mode.
		- #10. Use RenderDoc to find out where you're wasting drawing calls.
		- #11. Texture/Mesh LOD biases for quick gains.
		- #12. Trigger all shaders & GPUParticles during load time.
		- #13. Huge PackedByteArrays in text format are extremely slow to read.
		- #14. Always export resources as binaries.
		- #15. For some optimizations you might need to go lower. C++ 
				- Luckily, Godot's code is pretty easy to read.
		- #16. Save materials as resources, don't keep them embedded in the scenes.

- TTBTT: Porting tips
		- #17. Always set up a fallback font.
				- Godot uses the first available system font, but not all platforms provide one.
 		- #18. Don't use WorkerThreadPools jobs for loading stuff.
				- Even the best juggler has a ball limit.
 		- #19. Disable Android frame pacing.
 		- #20. Don't save the game too often.
				- Save settings when leaving the settings menu.
				- Save collectibles after ending the level.
		- #21. You only need to load the game saves once.

- TTBTT: Porting tips
		- #22. Spend some time learning the debugging tools that the platform provides.
		- #23. Try tinkering with every setting in the Project Settings and Viewport properties.
		- #24. For single-player games, accept input from any available controllers.
 
- TTBTT: About indie publishing

	- Publishing means "to be able to port and distribute a game".
			- Indie means ____ ____ ____ _ _ ___ __ __.

	- Before making a big game, first do a smaller project to learn the process.

	- Publishers, mid-tier and up, will be able to boost your game...
		- ... but be careful with some of the smaller ones.
		- Always ask for references.
	
	- I have heard stories of developers never getting paid any royalties because of unjustifiable recoup clauses.

- TTBTT: About indie publishing
image=gnomos.png
	- The best marketing strategies are:
			- · Making a good appealing & interesting game.
			- · Having the game developers promoting it from day 1.
			- · Having a time machine and releasing the game in 2020.

	- Publishers can help to multiply the effect of that marketing, but that will only work if the game developer has already built some community.

	- Same game could sell 10,000 or 100 copies.
			- Timing the release date well is as extremely important as impossible. Very luck based.

- TTBTT: About indie publishing
slide=base
	- A good publisher will propose changes to the game.
			- · They're experienced editors and know what players usually like.
			- · Short & fun is better than long & boring.
			- · Unfair hard games don't usually sell well.
	
	- A developer that won't accept any changes is never worth the effort.
			- · Probable dead game on release.
	
	- Programmers are not good at considering games for succesful publishing.
			- · We see the good game behind not appealing art.

- TTBTT: About indie publishing
slide=left_image
image=gnomos.png
	- The "comes and goes" heavily drain our energies.
		
		- Of course, game developers should take their time to explore different publishers' proposals.
		
		- But if in January we propose a release for October, please don't have us on hold until September.
		
		- These common industry quirks end up provoking delays and breaking schedules. 🫠

- Last thoughts & conclusions
image=panreyes.jpg
	- As of today, I still haven't created any games with Godot 🥲.
	- My most successful game was PiX Pang...
			- · Released 20 years ago, +200,000 free downloads.
			- · Someone did a remake with Scratch 🥲
	- If you do porting/publishing, you will make a bit of money, but you won't have time to create games.

	- On one side, I look forward to get started on Xbox&PS5 porting.
	- On the other hand, I already have too many on-going projects!
	
	- And RAWRLAB Games is not even my main job 🙃

- Last thoughts & conclusions (for real now)
image=panreyes.jpg
	- Publishing & porting smaller games is really tiring and most of the times does not pay up
			- but I love being able to help so many games
			- and meeting so many amazing creators.
			- (and luckily I don't have to pay the bills with it!)

	- There are too many games and there's no sure way to make a hit.
			- What worked yesterday, today won't.
			- So please create something that makes you happy.


- How can I donate for improving the ports?

		- [b][/b]
	
	
	- If you use any FOSS software, try to chip in.
	- Your donations will truly improve these ports:
